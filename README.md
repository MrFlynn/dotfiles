# .dotfiles
These are the dotfile I use (for the most part) on personal Linux and Unix systems. 

## Installation
Just run the installation script. It will warn you if you are missing any
dependencies or if the script was unable to automatically install them.

Once installed, just restart your shell.

```bash
$ ./install.sh
$ exec zsh
```
