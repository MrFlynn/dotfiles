## .dotfiles

These are the dotfile I use (for the most part) on \*nix systems that I work on. 

### Installation:
#### - Mac:
Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh), zsh, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), 
and git before you get started.

#### - Linux:
Using whatever package manager, zsh, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), 
and git.

#### - Final step:
Change your default shell to zsh with:
`$ chsh -s $(which zsh)`

#### - Let's install:
From the terminal, run these commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MrFlynn/dotfiles.git --depth 1
$ cd dotfiles/
$ ./install.sh
```
